### Weather App
This Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to search for and view the current weather conditions for any city. The app fetches real-time weather data from an external API and displays relevant information such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed. It also features a toggle button to switch between light and dark themes.
